<h1>The Deffrence between Put and Patch Method?</h1>
<p>I use Put when update the whole model and use patch when i want to update a portion or single attribute. For instance, a user may have a username they change that is stored on the user model. i would patch just the username when they change it. If i would like to replace the whole user model with a new user model i would use a put request.</p>
